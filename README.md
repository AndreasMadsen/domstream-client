#domstream-client

> domstream-client aims provide the same API as [domstream](https://github.com/AndreasMadsen/domstream).
> But it do not implement a HTML parser, instread it depends on the browser DOM.

##Goal

1. Provide the same API as domstream
2. Be small
3. Don't care about speed, the DOM is slow anyway

##Installation

```sheel
npm install domstream-client
```

##Example

```JavaScript
var doc = window.domstream(document);

// find and modify the title
var title = doc.find().only().elem('title')
               .toValue().setContent('new title');
```

## API documentation

Please see [domstream](https://github.com/AndreasMadsen/domstream) for documentation.
The following is not the implemented API but the differences.

### Document

The `Document` object do not support any `ReadStream` interface.

#### document.copy()

This is not supported, sugestions and patches are wellcome.

#### document.live(flag)

Because the real DOM always parse the content when using `HTMLElement.insertAdjacentHTML`
this feature is not supported. But compared to `domstream` the flag is always `true`.

#### document.content

This is not supported, sugestions and patches are wellcome.

#### document.container(list)

This dosen't do anything, since there is no `ReadStream` interface.

### Search

Search behaves excaltly like it would in `domstream`

### Node

Node behaves almost like it would in `domstream`.

#### node.isSingleton()

A singleton element is one of the following:

```JavaScript
['br', 'col', 'link', 'hr', 'command', 'embed', 'img', 'input', 'meta', 'param', 'source'];
```

Unlike `domstream` it do not care about `/>`.

This list can be acessed and extended by `window.domstream.NO_ENDING_TAG`.

#### node.done()

Doesn't really do anything.
